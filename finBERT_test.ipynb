    "Here s what investors need to know \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing things locally\n",
    "GeekWire reports that Apple has scooped up Xnor ai  a Seattle based start up that specializes in on device AI  Xnor ai was previously spun out of Microsoft co founder Paul Allen s AI incubator  the Allen Institute for AI  AI2   back in 2017  The company provides tools through a self service platform that allow other developers to incorporate AI into their apps \n",
    "Apple paid an estimated  200 million for Xnor ai  according to the report  Apple had previously acquired another Seattle based AI start up  Turi  back in 2016  also for around  200 million \n",
    "\n",
    "Xnor ai s main differentiator is that its technology keeps all of the AI processing on the local device as opposed to relying on data centers in the cloud  Apple prefers to store as much data locally as possible in order to improve privacy protections \n",
    "Apple s A series of chips include a neural engine that handles most of the machine learning and AI locally on iPhones  with the latest A13 Bionic chip boasting significant machine learning performance improvements thanks to its eight core neural engine  Sensitive biometric data used for Face ID or Touch ID is also stored locally in what Apple calls a Secure Enclave \n",
    "At the same time  low power computing is critical to improving battery life  The start up showed off an AI chip last year that used so little energy  it could run off solar power \n",
    "In recent years  Apple has been aggressively expanding in Seattle  The company said last summer that the Emerald City would  become a key engineering hub  that would employ 2 000 workers within the next few years  The Mac maker s office is right around the corner from Amazon s headquarters  and Apple is undoubtedly poaching talent from its rival \n",
    "Sorry  Wyze\n",
    "Xnor ai s tech was incorporated into Wyze s smart home security cameras last summer  enabling people detection on the affordable    the entry level Wyze Cam V2 costs just  20    devices that was all processed locally  Just a few months after that feature was added  Wyze said in November that the people detection capability would be removed in January 2020 after Xnor ai terminated its contract \n",
    "Wyze is internally developing a comparable feature  although it may use the cloud instead of on device processing  The timing of all of that probably isn t a coincidence  It s entirely possible that Apple bought Xnor ai a couple months ago and investors are just now finding out\n",

(\"Holdings\") was organized in July, 1989 to\\nacquire American Medical International, Inc. (\"AMI\" and, together with Holdings,\\nthe \"Company\"). As a result of this acquisition, Holdings is the owner of all of\\nthe outstanding shares of common stock of AMI.\\n\\n    The Company  is one  of the  leading hospital  management companies  in  the\\nUnited  States.  Generally,  the Company\\'s  hospitals  provide a  full  range of\\ninpatient and  outpatient  services including  medical/surgical,  obstetric  and\\ndiagnostic  services and  services provided  by intensive  care units, emergency\\nrooms,  laboratories  and  pharmacies.  The  Company  also  operates   ancillary\\nfacilities  at each of its hospitals, such as ambulatory, occupational and rural\\nhealthcare clinics. At August 31, 1993,  the Company operated 35 domestic  acute\\ncare hospitals and one psychiatric hospital containing a total of 8,003 licensed\\nbeds.  The Company\\'s hospitals  are principally located in  the suburbs of major\\nmetropolitan areas in 12 states including Texas, Florida and California. Through\\nbroad networks including  health maintenance  organizations, preferred  provider\\norganizations,  insurers  and  employers,  the  Company  provides  high quality,\\naffordable  health  services  while  facing  the  challenge  of  containing  the\\ncontinually rising healthcare costs.\\n\\n    Management  expects that the  Company\\'s ongoing control  of costs emphasized\\nduring fiscal  1993 will  provide the  Company a  competitive edge  to  increase\\nmarket  share notwithstanding  the presence  of a  managed care  environment. In\\nresponse to the  ever-changing healthcare  system, the  shift toward  outpatient\\nservices,  the need  to reduce  provider costs  for acute-care  services and the\\nClinton Administration\\'s desire to provide  universal access to healthcare,  the\\nCompany  is developing  physician networks  and alliances  with other healthcare\\nproviders to create fully integrated healthcare delivery systems.\\n\\n    Holdings and AMI are Delaware corporations with principal executive  offices\\nlocated  at  8201  Preston  Road,  Suite  300,  P.O.  Box  25651,  Dallas, Texas\\n75225-5651. The telephone number for Holdings  and AMI at such address is  (214)\\n360-6300. AMI was incorporated in 1957.\\n\\n    PROPERTIES\\n\\n    The  Company  owns  or  leases  and operates  the  following  35  acute care\\nhospitals and one psychiatric hospital.\\n\\n1\\n\\nThe Company  also  owns or  manages  medical office  buildings  and  related\\nhealthcare  facilities associated  with 31 of  its hospitals as  well as certain\\nundeveloped properties.\\n\\n                                       2\\n \\n    EMPLOYEES\\n\\n    As of August 31,  1993, the Company had  approximately 28,200 employees,  of\\nwhich approximately 66% were full time employees. Two of the Company\\'s hospitals\\nhad  labor  contracts  covering  approximately 5%  of  the  Company\\'s employees.\\nManagement  believes  that  its  relations  with  its  employees  generally  are\\nsatisfactory.\\n\\n    MEDICAL STAFFS\\n\\n    The  medical  staff  at  each hospital  generally  consists  of non-employee\\nphysicians. There  is a  trend in  the healthcare  industry in  some regions  to\\nemploy  physicians and where  appropriate, the Company\\'s  hospitals have pursued\\nthis option. Medical staff members of  the Company-owned hospitals that are  not\\nemployees usually also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by the\\nCompany  and may terminate their  relationships with the Company-owned hospitals\\nat any time.\\n\\n    Rules and  regulations concerning  the medical  aspects of  each  hospital\\'s\\noperations  are  adopted  and enforced  by  its  medical staff.  Such  rules and\\nregulations provide that the members of  the staff elect officers who,  together\\nwith  additional physicians selected by them, supervise all medical and surgical\\nprocedures and services. Their supervision  is subject to the general  oversight\\nof the hospital\\'s Governing Board.\\n\\n    QUALITY OF SERVICES\\n\\n    Management  believes the quality of healthcare services is critical in order\\nto attract  and retain  top physicians  and  increase the  market share  of  the\\nCompany\\'s  hospitals. One of the  key mechanisms used to  monitor the quality of\\ncare at  the Company\\'s  hospitals is  a quality  assurance program  designed  to\\nmeasure   patient  satisfaction,  the  Patient  Satisfaction  Monitoring  System\\n(\"PSMS\"). PSMS utilizes the  results of interviews  performed by an  independent\\nresearch  company  of  a  statistically determined  sample  group  of discharged\\npatients at each  hospital to  gather patient responses  regarding the  hospital\\nservices  provided. Management uses the results as a tool to improve the quality\\nof patient services and satisfaction and believes PSMS has assisted the  Company\\nin successfully maintaining and improving the quality of healthcare as perceived\\nby  patients  and  their physicians  and  thereby contributing  to  improved net\\nrevenues. PSMS  is also  used by  the Company  as one  of the  bases upon  which\\nhospital  executive  directors and  other  employees are  compensated  under the\\nCompany\\'s incentive compensation program.  Management believes that the  Company\\nwas  the first in the industry to directly tie compensation to the attainment of\\nqualitative performance targets.\\n\\n    The Company  has  recently developed  a  system  similar to  PSMS  which  is\\ndesigned  to measure physician satisfaction, the MD Satisfaction Survey. A pilot\\nprogram for this  survey has been  implemented at one  hospital and the  Company\\nplans  to make it available for use at each of the Company\\'s hospitals in fiscal\\n1994.\\n\\n    COMPETITION\\n\\n    Generally, other  investor-owned and  non-profit  hospitals operate  in  the\\nlocal  markets in which  the Company participates and  provide services that are\\nsimilar to those offered by the Company\\'s hospitals. Competition among hospitals\\nand other healthcare  providers in  the United  States has  increased in  recent\\nyears  due to a decline  in occupancy rates resulting  from, among other things,\\nchanges in  government  regulation  and reimbursement,  other  cost  containment\\npressures, technology, and most recently, the healthcare reform plan proposed by\\nthe Clinton Administration. Additionally, hospitals owned by government agencies\\nor  other  tax-exempt  entities  benefit  from  advantages  such  as endowments,\\ncharitable contributions  and tax-exempt  financing,  which advantages  are  not\\navailable to the Company\\'s hospitals.\\n\\n    Management  believes  that a  hospital\\'s  competitive position  within local\\nmarkets is  affected by  various  factors including  the quality  of  healthcare\\nservices  provided, pricing of healthcare  services, the hospital\\'s location and\\nthe types of services offered. The Company expects to improve the performance of\\nits  hospitals  by  (i)   expanding  physician  network  relationships   thereby\\nattracting and retaining\\n\\n                                       3\\n \\nquality physician and medical personnel, (ii) increasing its emphasis on managed\\ncare  contracting,  (iii)  developing  and  marketing  new  healthcare  services\\ntargeted to the particular needs of the communities served by its hospitals, and\\n(iv) expanding profitable outpatient services.\\n\\n    The competitive  position of  a  hospital is  increasingly affected  by  its\\nability  to  negotiate  contracts  for  healthcare  services  with  managed care\\norganizations, including  health maintenance  organizations (\"HMOs\"),  preferred\\nprovider  organizations  (\"PPOs\")  and  other  purchasers  of  group  healthcare\\nservices. HMOs and PPOs attempt to  direct and control use of hospital  services\\nthrough  strict  utilization  management programs  and  by  negotiating provider\\ncontracts with only one or  a limited number of  hospitals in each market  area.\\nThe importance of negotiating with managed care organizations varies from market\\nto  market  depending on  the  market strength  of  such organizations.  In some\\nsituations, hospitals  have agreed  to fixed  payments based  on the  number  of\\nmanaged  care  enrollees,  thereby  assuming  hospital  utilization  risk  (such\\ncontracts are referred  to as capitated  contracts). Managed care  organizations\\nare  generally  able  to  obtain discounts  from  hospital  established charges.\\nManagement believes that the Company is able to compete effectively for  managed\\ncare  business in part  because of its relationships  with local physicians, its\\nhospital management teams, its attention to cost controls and quality of service\\nand its  strategies to  establish  service niches  in  markets served  by  other\\nhospitals.\\n\\n    Merger   and  acquisition  activity  has   significantly  increased  in  the\\nhealthcare industry involving  both investor-owned and  non-profit entities.  As\\nhealthcare   reforms  announced  by  the  Clinton  Administration  take  effect,\\nmanagement believes that it will become  more important for hospitals and  other\\nhealthcare  providers  to  work  together to  form  fully  integrated healthcare\\ndelivery systems and  thereby provide  the community and  marketplace with  high\\nquality, cost effective healthcare products and services. During fiscal 1993 the\\nCompany  entered into an  agreement with HealthTrust,  Inc.-The Hospital Company\\n(\"HealthTrust\") to jointly  operate AMI\\'s  Tarzana Regional  Medical Center  and\\nHealthTrust\\'s  Encino  Hospital.  Management  is  continually  evaluating  other\\nsimilar opportunities  and acquisitions  to  expand the  networks in  which  the\\nCompany currently participates.\\n\\n    SOURCES OF REVENUE\\n\\n    The  sources of the Company\\'s  hospital revenues are room  and board and the\\nprovision of ancillary  medical services.  Room and board  represents the  basic\\ncharges for the hospital room and related services, such as general nursing care\\nand  meals.  Ancillary medical  services represent  the  charges related  to the\\nmedical support activities performed by  the hospital, such as X-rays,  physical\\ntherapy  and laboratory procedures.  The Company receives  payments for services\\nrendered to patients from the federal government under Medicare and the Civilian\\nHealth and Medical  Program of  Uniformed Services  (\"CHAMPUS\") programs,  state\\ngovernments under their respective Medicaid programs, managed care organizations\\n(\"contracted  services\"), private insurers,  self-insured employers and directly\\nfrom patients. In addition to revenues received from such programs and patients,\\nthe Company receives other  non-patient revenues (e.g.  cafeteria and gift  shop\\nrevenues).  During fiscal 1991, the  Company also recognized revenues associated\\nwith an HMO owned by the Company and divested in fiscal 1991.\\n\\n    The following table presents  the percentage of net  revenues for the  three\\nyears ended August 31 under each of the following programs:\\n\\nThe  Company\\'s hospital revenues received under Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS,\\nBlue Cross  and from  payors  of contracted  services  are generally  less  than\\ncustomary  charges for the  services covered. Following  the initiative taken by\\nthe federal government to control healthcare costs, other\\n\\n                                       4\\n \\nmajor purchasers  of  healthcare,  including  states,  insurance  companies  and\\nemployers,  are increasingly negotiating the amounts  they will pay for services\\nperformed  rather  than  simply  paying  healthcare  providers  their  customary\\ncharges.  Managed  care  programs  which offer  prepaid  and  discounted medical\\nservice packages are  capturing an increasing  share of the  market, tending  to\\nreduce  the historical  rate of  growth of hospital  revenues. As  a result, new\\nkinds of healthcare strategies and  provider networks (e.g. physician  networks)\\nare continuing to emerge.\\n\\n    Patients  are generally not responsible for any difference between customary\\nhospital charges and  amounts reimbursed under  Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS  and\\nsome  Blue Cross plans  or by payors  of contracted services  for such services,\\nexcept to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features  of\\ntheir  coverage. In  recent years insurers  and other payors  have increased the\\namount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance generally increasing the\\npatient\\'s financial  responsibility  to  directly pay  for  some  services.  The\\nincrease  in the  self-pay portion of  a patient\\'s  financial responsibility may\\nalso increase the Company\\'s uncollectible accounts.\\n'\n",
