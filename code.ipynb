      "I have no doubt Janet Yellen s head slammed the table in frustration last week  As China devalued the value of its yuan  Yellen s job got much  much harder \n",
      "In fact  we d argue the global economic picture has never been quite so muddled and quite so dangerous  What has us worried is the growing gap between monetary policies across the world \n",
      "We re convinced the traditional idea of interest rates  at least in our investing lifetimes  is dead  As much as Yellen and her troops want to nudge rates higher and reload their ammo belt  divergent forces from across the globe are forcing them to move cautiously \n",
      "The news out of China last week is a perfect example  As Beijing works to decouple its yuan from the rising dollar  it puts an even brighter spotlight on the rising dollar  The greenback is an oasis in a monetary desert \n",
      "It s not good news for Yellen  After all  if she pushes rates higher  it will be the equivalent of pouring gas on an already hot fire  While most other economies are working to slash the value of their currencies  the Fed is ready to overtly strengthen the value of ours  It s dangerous \n",
      "Yes  87  of our economy is domestic  But if you ve paid attention to the recent earnings reports from the multinationals that have teased this bull market forward  you know a strong dollar is cutting into profits  Everywhere we look  companies are griping about a strong dollar \n",
      "For example  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  shareholders should absolutely be concerned over what happened in Beijing last week  With China acting as the company s second largest market  after the Americas   the falling value of the yuan could instantly shave several percentage points from Apple s profits  It s not good news for a market leader that s already starting to sputter  And Apple s not alone \n",
      "Beer giant Molson Coors Brewing Company  NYSE TAP  felt the pain of a strong dollar   its European sales dropped nearly 17  over the last three months  Its stock is now in a downtrend  too \n",
      "And shares of Fossil  NASDAQ FOSL  sank by over 8  between Tuesday and Wednesday as the company warned about the effects of the strong dollar \n",
      "For the folks at the Fed who are already worried about an anemic recovery  the strong dollar is an itchy thorn in the side  If they raise rates and send the dollar even higher  they ll very likely send the value of many multinational companies lower  They ll kill the bull market  And they may strangle our recovery \n",
      "For that reason  we re convinced the Fed won t make any bold moves  We might see a token increase  but nothing more \n",
      "Even bigger  though  we re convinced we ve seen the death of interest rates as we know them  In our investing lifetimes  we ll never see another period of  normal  interest rates  Central banks across the globe have simply gotten themselves in a trap   a trap they can t escape from without gnawing their own leg off \n",
      "What s an investor to do \n",
      "You ve accomplished the first step  You re aware of the situation and the dangers it poses  From here  you must invest according to the threat  With interest rates remaining low  you ll need to find safe dividend income  That means largely focusing on domestic companies  Sectors that stand independent of the global economy will do well  Healthcare and technology are two standouts \n",

      "Content: With a major overhaul in tax laws in more than 30 years  U S  corporates are expected to see a significant increase in their cash pile  While the slashing of the corporate tax from 35  to 21  will lead to a rise in profit after tax  a cash repatriation window will allow multinational corporations to bring in cash stashed in foreign countries  Boosted by the surge in domestic cash  many companies may opt for mergers   acquisitions  M A   share buybacks or dividend pay out next year or beyond Here we will focus on stocks  which are expected to pay better dividends in 2018 than their industry peers and also have growth prospects  While the upside momentum of the market may continue amid strong manufacturing data  rising corporate profits and interest rates  risks of a downside remain  In such an environment  investors can add these stocks to their portfolio to enjoy a steady stream of cashGenerally  companies paying dividends are financially stable accruing profits in established markets  Share buyback programs and dividend payouts boost investor confidence in the company  thereby raising its market value  However  with interest rates rising in the United States  some amount of cash may flow to the debt market  However  this does not weaken the prospects of dividend investing  With investors getting worried about the Bull Run and many even expecting a correction  dividend paying companies are better bets for 2018 7 Amazing Dividend StocksIt is no easy task to select outperformers given the vast size of the market  Therefore  we are using the Zacks Rank to zero in on companies with strong fundamentals  In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank  we are also taking into account   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  With our   we have identified stocks that have potential to beat the market The score allows one to streamline their search to select winners by eliminating the negative aspects  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   offer the best upside potential Apart from a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM score  we have chosen large cap companies  This lowers the risk of the portfolio as these companies are less susceptible to market volatility  Moreover  the companies have seen EPS  sales and dividend payout increase in the last five years  Although  past growth is not an indicator of future movement  it helps to select companies that have a higher probability of paying dividends  The companies have also performed better than the S P 500 this year  However  these have a low PEG ratio  which suggests room for upside Here are seven of the 18 stocks that fit the bill Intel Corporation   NASDAQ INTC   designs  manufactures
